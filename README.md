A Kotlin client for Discord bots

Built as a lean, opinionated client using coroutines that gets the intricacies of rate limits, async, and data models out of your way.

Feel free to submit a PR or an Issue and I'll address it ASAP.

## How do I use this?

Proper documentation needs to be written, but the concept for now is very simple.
Instantiate each client as you like to access the methods Discord offers for that particular resource.
To build a live bot, simply create a DiscordWebSocket with an EventListener, overriding the event methods you want to know about.

### Ping Pong Example
```kotlin
const val BOT_TOKEN = "A-Totally-Real-Discord-Bot-Token"

val clientStore = ClientStore(BOT_TOKEN)

object BotListener : EventListener() {
    override suspend fun onMessageCreate(message: Message) {
        if (message.content == "ping") {
            clientStore.channels[message.channelId].sendMessage("pong")
        }
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    DiscordWebSocket(BOT_TOKEN, BotListener())
}
```

### Experimental DSL Ping Pong Example
```kotlin
const val BOT_TOKEN = "A-Totally-Real-Discord-Bot-Token"

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    bot(BOT_TOKEN) {
        events {
            any { eventType, data, clients ->
                println("We got an event")
            }

            typingStart { eventType, data, clients ->
                println("Someone started typing something")
            }
        }

        commands {
            command("ping") { params, authorId, channel, clients ->
                channel.sendMessage("pong")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## FAQ
* Does this support voice chat?
    * No, voice chat is not supported. If you need it I recommend checking out [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) or [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J)
* Is this library production ready?
    * Absolutely not, it is far from battle tested, lacks documentation, and could always use more tests
* Can I still use Diskord if I really want to?
    * Yes. It hasn't been thoroughly tested, it complies with the full Bot API and WebSocket interface
* Can I contact you to ask a question/contribute to the project/tell you this is all shit?
    * Go for it

## Things to do
- Add more testing
- Proper documentation
